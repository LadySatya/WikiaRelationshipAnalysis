    "notes": "LLM groups same character's variations with '|' (e.g., 'Zuko | Fire Lord Zuko') and lists different characters separately (note the two 'Bumi' entries - King Bumi from ATLA and Commander Bumi from LOK). This approach eliminates hardcoded title lists and works for any fictional universe."
